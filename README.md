# packetSniffer

## Description
A very basic Packet Sniffer program written in C++ using the PCAP library to capture and print out packet data in HEX and ASCII format. It should be noted that it is **not** analysing packet data as of now.

## Plans
* To implement packet analysis.
* To implement GUI.
